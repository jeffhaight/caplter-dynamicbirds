Quarries are important nesting sites (Tucker and Heath 1994) and  birds may use other man-made habitats including road and railway  cuttings and building work excavations. Suitability of breeding sites depends on erosion which both creates new sites and destroys old ones (Turner 2004). Breeding occurs between late  April and August usually with two clutches of between three and six  eggs. Burrows are excavated by both male and female but male initiates  the process. Erosion at breeding sites is vital for creating new nest  sites which birds prefer. Sand martins may roost in reedbeds. They  forage approximately 15 m above ground (Turner 2004) feeding mainly on  insects but also taking spiders (Tucker and Heath 1994, Turner 2004).  Important foraging habitats include water-bodies, grassland and farmland  (Turner 2004). Urban and forested areas are less important. This  species is migratory with Eurasian birds typically wintering in the  Sahel zone and East Africa south to Mozambique (Tucker and Heath 1994).  Breeding birds in North America migrate to South America (Turner 2004). Adult birds migrate soon after breeding. Juveniles roam over a wide  area. Most adult birds return to the same breeding colony in subsequent  years (Turner 2004).","Breeding sites are generally ephemeral and can often be lost through  human activities (e.g. flood control, erosion control on rivers). In  Europe, it is often dependent on artificial breeding sites such as  quarries (Turner 2004), however quarry work can adversely affect  breeding, though workers often take measures to prevent this. The use of  pesticides causing declines in prey species, may impact the species  (Tucker and Heath 1994). In the past droughts in wintering areas have  caused severe large-scale population declines in western Europe (Tucker  and Heath 1994, Turner 2004).","The European population is estimated at 3,640,000-8,000,000 pairs, which equates to 7,280,000-16,000,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Therefore it is likely that the global population falls in the band 10,000,000-500,000,000 mature individuals. National population estimates include:   c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration   in China; c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and &lt; c.50 wintering individuals in   Japan, and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on   migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).","Decreasing","","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Bern Convention  Appendix II.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","This species breeds in a wide range of climates and over a wide altitudinal range. It prefers open country, such as farmland where buildings provide nesting sites and where water is nearby. It is primarily a rural species in Europe and North America, whilst in north Africa and Asia it often breeds in towns and cities (Turner and Christie 2012). In Europe, it is superseded by the House Martin (<em>Delichon urbicum</em>) in urban areas (Turner and Rose 1989).&#160;<br/><br/>The breeding season lasts from May to August. The nest is built by both sexes and is a cup or half-cup, made from mud pellets mixed with fibres such as dry grass, straw and horsehair and lined with dry grass and white feathers. Originally, nests were built in caves or on cliffs, but now almost always on artificial structures. Clutches consist of two to seven eggs (Turner and Christie 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Barn Swallow feeds almost entirely on flying insects (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory, with European birds wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), although some individuals winter in southern and western Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds breeding in North America winter in South America, whilst birds breeding in East Asia winter in South Asia (Turner and Christie 2012).","The main threat to the species is the intensification of agriculture. Changes in farming practices, such as the abandonment of traditional milk and beef production, have resulted in a loss of suitable foraging areas. In addition, intensive livestock rearing, land drainage and the use of herbicides and pesticides all reduce the numbers of insect prey available. Suitable nest sites are often scarcer on modern farms. The species is susceptible to changes in climate, with bad weather in the wintering areas as well as the breeding grounds affecting breeding success (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is occasionally hunted for sport, and nests are sometimes removed as a nuisance. In North America, introduced House Sparrows (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) are serious nest-site competitors, taking over nests and destroying eggs and nestlings (Turner and Christie 2012).","The European population&#160;is estimated at 29-48.7 million pairs, which equates to 58-97.4 million mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;Europe forms approximately 20% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 290-487 million mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. National population estimates include: 10,000-1 million breeding pairs and &gt;1,000 individuals on migration   in China; 10,000-100,000 breeding pairs, &gt;10,000 individuals on   migration and &lt;50 wintering individuals in Taiwan; 10,000-1 million   breeding pairs and &gt;1,000 individuals on migration in Korea; 10,000-1   million breeding pairs, &gt;1,000 individuals on migration and 50-1,000   wintering individuals in Japan, as well as 10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and 1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).","Decreasing","","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Bern Convention Appendix II.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Northern populations of this species are migratory, with those breeding in the western Palearctic travelling on a broad front across the Sahara (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and those breeding in North American travelling on a narrow front along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Post-breeding southward movements occur from September to October and return northward movements occur from March to May (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Tropical populations are not migratory but may undergo seasonal post-breeding dispersive movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). In temperate regions breeding occurs in the local spring, with tropical and subtropical nesting generally coinciding with the rains (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests in small numbers (Snow and Perrins 1998) in single- or mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although sometimes groups may reach several thousand pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). When nesting within mixed-species colonies the species tends to form monospecific clusters (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species's aggregatory behaviour outside of the breeding season varies much throughout its range, some populations (e.g. in America) remaining highly gregarious throughout the year (Snow and Perrins 1998) and gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands to roost (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), others (e.g. Palearctic breeders) being largely solitary except when roosting or on migration (Snow and Perrins 1998) (roosting flocks of 2-6 to 200 are known in Africa (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1992) and small flocks occur on migration) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is largely crepuscular and nocturnal, but may feed diurnally especially during the breeding season (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits fresh, brackish or saline waters with aquatic vegetation and bamboo or trees (e.g. pine, oak or mangroves) for roosting and nesting in (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), showing a preference for islands or predator-free areas for nesting sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occupies the forested margins of shallow rivers, streams, lagoons, pools, ponds, lakes, marshes and mangroves and may feed on pastures, reservoirs, canals, aquaculture ponds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and rice-fields (up to 96 % of a colony's food resources may be taken from nearby rice-fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On migration the species may also frequent dry grasslands or marine coasts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), kelp beds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). It breeds up to 4,800 m (Chile) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) but is more common at elevations of up to c.2,000 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> It is an opportunistic feeder taking fish, frogs, tadpoles, turtles, snakes, lizards, adult and larval insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and dragonflies) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, leeches, small rodents, bats and the eggs and chicks of other bird species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is platform constructed of sticks and vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) placed 2-50 m above water or on dry ground near water (Snow and Perrins 1998) in trees, bushes, reedbeds, on cliff ledges (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (overhanging rivers) (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) and on the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in protected sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests close together in single- and mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with as many as 20-30 pairs in the same tree (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Colony sites may be reused in consecutive years or flocks may move to new sites (usually such movements are a result of nesting trees being destroyed due to the colony's nesting activities) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Colony sites are dispersed throughout the landscape in relation to distance from feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).  <strong>Management information</strong> A study carried out in north-west Italy suggests that existing nesting sites should be protected and that breeding habitats should be actively managed in order to maintain suitable habitat characteristics (Fasola and Alieri 1992). The creation of a network of new nesting sites spaced at 4-10 km in relation to available foraging habitats in zones currently without suitable nesting sites is also recommended (Fasola and Alieri 1992).","The species is threatened by wetland drainage and destruction (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and by drought in wintering areas (Hafner and Kushlan 2002). It is highly susceptible to pesticides (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kwon <em>et al.</em> 2004, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) such as organophosphates, carbamates (Kwon <em>et al.</em> 2004) and DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) which negatively affect hatching success (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). There are also cases of genetic damage to chicks as a result of petroleum contamination (Custer 2000). The species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and Newcastle disease so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). It is also persecuted (anti-predation killing) at aquaculture facilities due to its depredation on fish stocks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and has suffered declines due to the exploitation of chicks from nesting colonies in the past (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Utilisation</strong> Chicks of the species are still taken for food in some areas (e.g. Madagascar) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Hafner 200) and adults are hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The global   population is estimated to number c.570,000-3,730,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 60,000-86,100 pairs, which equates to 120,000-172,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;National population estimates include: c.100,000-1   million breeding pairs, &gt;c.10,000 individuals on migration and   &gt;c.10,000 wintering individuals in China; c.100,000-1 million breeding   pairs in Taiwan; c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 wintering   individuals in Korea and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000   individuals on migration in Japan (Brazil 2009).","Decreasing","","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: A study carried out in north-west Italy suggests that existing nesting sites should be protected and that breeding habitats should be actively managed in order to maintain suitable habitat characteristics (Fasola and Alieri 1992).

In more temperate regions the species is sedentary or only locally dispersive however (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds solitarily or in loose colonies of 2-50 or occasionally up to several hundred pairs (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It is typically a gregarious species, occurring in small groups (Snow and Perrins 1998) (up to 15 individuals) (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) or larger flocks of several hundred up to a thousand individuals on migration, during the winter (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) and at nightly roosts (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species typically breeds in shallow freshwater and brackish wetlands with sand, mud or clay substrates and open margins, islets or spits near water level (Snow and Perrins 1998). Suitable habitats include marshes and swamps, shallow lake edges, riverbeds, flooded fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), irrigated areas (Snow and Perrins 1998), sewage ponds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and fish-ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also breed around alkaline and high-altitude (montane) lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) or in more saline environments such as river deltas, estuaries (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow coastal pools with extensive areas of mudflats, salt meadows (Johnsgard 1981), saltpans, coastal marshes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species occupies the shores of large inland waterbodies and estuarine or coastal habitats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) such as river deltas (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow freshwater or brackish pools with extensive areas of mudflats, salt meadows (Johnsgard 1981), saltpans, coastal marshes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet is strongly seasonal (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) but generally includes adult and larval aquatic insects (e.g. Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata, Diptera, Neuroptera and Lepidoptera), molluscs, crustaceans, spiders, oligochaete and polychaete worms, tadpoles (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and amphibian spawn (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), small fish, fish eggs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and occasionally seeds (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a depression (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) or shallow scrape positioned on hard ground near water on a hummock (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) or amongst grass and sedge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Alternatively the nest may be a more elaborate platform of vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998) constructed on a floating mass of aquatic vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species nests singly or in loose colonies (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), showing a preference for open areas close to foraging sites with good all-round (360 degree) visibility (Johnsgard 1981).","","The global   population is estimated to number c.450,000-780,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 53,900-75,700 pairs, which equates to 108,000-151,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Increasing","","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine","","Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic",NA,"false","false","Global",0,0,0,0

Its diet is comprised mostly of fish, causing great congregations in areas with abundant prey. Prey species include sardines and anchovies, but has been seem to take shrimps and carrion, and even nestling egrets. It regularly feeds by plunge-diving and is often the victim of kleptoparasites. The timing of breeding varies depending on latitude, breeding in spring in the extreme north of its range compared to all year round in the tropics. Brown Pelicans are colonial, with some colonies being maintained over several years. It mostly nests on the ground, sometimes on cliffs and less often in small trees or bushes. Movements and migrations depend on local conditions (e.g. northern populations migrate south) (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992).","<p>This species is highly sensitive to organochlorine pesticides (Blus 1982). In the past, bioaccumulation of DDT in the marine environment severely impaired the speciesâ reproductive success through eggshell thinning and breakage (Blus 1982, 1984) and increased adult mortality (Keith <em>et al.</em> 1971). Following the ban on general use of DDT in the US (Environmental Protection Agency 1972), eggshell thickness, productivity and population sizes increased (Mendenhall and Prouty 1978, Blus 1982).<br/><br/>Ongoing threats include injuries caused by entanglement in fishing hooks and lines (Hanson <em>et al.</em> 2014), the collapse of sardine populations along the west coast of America, unintentional disturbance from tourists of birds in breeding colonies, as well as intentional disturbance from fishermen (Elliott <em>et al.</em> 2018). There is evidence for human disturbance causing reduced breeding success in colonies nesting in the Gulf of California (Anderson and Keith 1980), Mexico (Anderson 1988) and Costa Rica (Stiles 1984).

This species occurs in a wide diversity of habitats, from tundra to semi-desert and in wooded or open country and is frequently found in agricultural or urban areas in Europe although almost always found near water. The species is generally monogamous and egg-laying begins in mid-March. It builds a shallow nest of vegetation, lined with down and feathers, on ground, frequently near waterbodies. Clutches are usually four to seven eggs (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014). The diet is primarily plant materials, including stems, leaves, tubers, fruits and seeds (Snow and Perrins 1998). Natural populations found in Greenland are mainly migratory, wintering in the southern states of the U.S.A. and along coasts of North America (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Europe, it is sedentary in some areas and migratory in other, and a moult migration takes place (Snow and Perrins 1998).","Although hunting and other direct mortality takes a substantial toll, this species has increased its range and population since the 1940s (Mowbray <em>et al</em>. 2002). Temperate breeders in Europe are frequently in conflict with human activities, for example, they may cause fouling of parks, golf courses or other recreational areas but also cause considerable crop damage in spring-winter to wheat and hayfields, and in the autumn to unharvested grains. As a result in Europe, farmers are permitted to scare or exceptionally shoot geese. In Sweden numbers killed rose from 17,000 in 1990 to 20,000-25,000 in 1996, with smaller numbers shot in Denmark, Germany and Norway. In addition, local governments with nuisance problems can request permission to destroy nests and eggs (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014).","The global population is estimated at c. 5,000,000-6,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 1,000-5,000 pairs, which equates to 2,000-10,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Increasing","This species has a large range, breeding across tundra in much of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Canada</span>, Alaska, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">U.S.A</span>., and parts of the northern U.S.A., and wintering in southern North America, including <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mexico</span>.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Most populations of this species are partially migratory, making long-distance dispersive movements related to food resources in connection with seasonal rainfall (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Other populations (e.g. in north-east Asia and North America) are fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds throughout the year in the tropics with different regional peaks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) depending on food availability (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds colonially, often with other species, in groups that number from a few dozen to several thousand pairs, even up to 10,000 pairs in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The nesting effort of the species is related to rainfall patterns, leading to an annual variation in productivity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), feeding in loose flocks of 10-20 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and often gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands of individuals where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Nocturnal roosting sites in Africa commonly hold a few hundred to 2,000 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and commonly associates with native grazing mammals or domesticated livestock (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and may follow farm machinery to capture disturbed prey (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits open grassy areas such as meadows (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), livestock pastures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), semi-arid steppe (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and open savanna grassland subject to seasonal inundation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), dry arable fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), artificial grassland sites (e.g. lawns, parks, road margins and sports fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), freshwater swamps, rice-fields, wet pastures (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), shallow marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and irrigated grasslands (with ponds, small impoundments, wells, canals, small rivers and streams) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It rarely occupies marine habitats or forested areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although in Australia it may enter woodlands and forests, and it shows a preference for freshwater (Marchant and Higgins 1990) although it may also use brackish or saline habitats (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to c.1,500 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or locally up to c.4,000 m (Peru) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists primarily of insects such as locusts, grasshoppers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), beetles, adult and larval Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, dragonflies (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and centipedes but worms (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), spiders (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), crustaceans, frogs, tadpoles, molluscs, fish, lizards, small birds, rodents and vegetable matter (e.g. palm-nut pulp) may also be taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of twigs and vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and is positioned up to 20 m high in reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), marshes, mangroves, dense thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes or trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually over or surrounded by water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups with the nests placed close or touching (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information</strong> The species can adversely affect the trees and bushes it uses for nesting, which may lead to the abandonment of the colony site if it is not managed (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","Large colonies nesting in urban areas are perceived as a public nuisance and may be persecuted (e.g. by disturbance to prevent colony establishment, removal or direct killing) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In its breeding range the species is threatened by wetland degradation and destruction such as lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Armenia) (Balian <em>et al.</em> 2002), and in some parts of its range it is susceptible to pesticide poisoning (organophosphates and carbamates) (Kwon <em>et al.</em> 2004). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The population is estimated to number 4,000,000-9,850,000 individuals.&#160;The European population is estimated at 76,100-92,300 pairs, which equates to 152,000-185,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It is a native-prairie specialist (Anstey <em>et al.</em> 1995)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, its breeding range restricted to short-grass and mixed-grass prairie regions, and its wintering range restricted to dry grasslands and deserts, where it feeds on grains in high density flocks (Hill and Gould 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It prefers native grasslands recently disturbed by fire, grazing or mowing, and will avoid nesting in areas protected from grazing or cultivated fields (Maher 1973, <strong></strong>Owens and Myres 1973)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;Critical habitat has been identified as open areas of upland native grassland &gt; 39 ha in fair to excellent range condition with flat to gently rolling topography and with limited woody vegetation or invasion by exotic grasses (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018, COSEWIC 2019, D. Hill <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>","As a result of conversion of native prairie to croplands and urban developments it has disappeared from much of its historical breeding range (e.g. in Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota); the species exhibits significantly lower nest survival and fledges fewer young in non-native grassland pastures compared to native prairies (Lloyd and Martin 2005, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Fragmentation of native grasslands reduces the suitability of breeding habitat (D. P. Hill and L. K. Gould&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016); a study in southern Saskatchewan found that the species did not use habitat patches &lt;39 ha (Davis 2004). Abundance, and nest fledging, success and productivity are reduced along roads (Sutter <em>et al</em>. 2000) and in close proximity to oil and gas wells (Ng 2017, Yoo and Koper 2017, Ng 2019, PCAP 2019). It exhibits delayed displacement (&gt;300 m) in response to wind energy infrastructure (Shaffer and Buhl 2015).&#160;Conversion of the species's wintering habitat to irrigated agriculture in Mexico also poses a threat (G. Butcher <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Recent conversion of grasslands to cropland in the Valles Centrales (the largest known wintering population of c.250,000 individuals) of Chihuahua, Mexico, is estimated to have displaced more than 130,000 wintering individuals (Pool <em>et al</em>. 2014). The wintering range has also contracted: this is presumed to have resulted from a population decline. Brown-headed cowbirds parasitise this species at low to moderate rates and there is a high level of predation by native predators (Hill and Gould 1997, Shaffer <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>. It can be vulnerable to disturbance (Hill and Gould 1997), and it has been reported killed at communication towers (Longcore <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;The species is also thought vulnerable to predicted drying as a result of climate change in the western part of its breeding range and in the wintering range (G. Butcher <em>in litt</em>. 2016), although Wilson <em>et al</em>. (2018) modelled data suggested that the species's range size illustrates no significant response to changing drought conditions.<p></p>","Partners in Flight (2019) currently estimate the population to number 3.1 million mature individuals.<p></p>","Decreasing","This species&#160;breeds in the Great Plains (north and central <strong>U.S.A.</strong>) and the Canadian Prairie Provinces (southern central <strong>Canada</strong>), and winters in south-central and south-western U.S.A.<strong> </strong>and north-central <strong>Mexico</strong> (Hill and Gould 1997, Ellison <em>et al</em>. 2017); it typically migrates along the central flyway to the east of breeding sites, circumventing high elevation terrain (Ellison <em>et al</em>. 2017).

A recovery strategy for the species has been proposed under the Species at Risk Act (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018). The plan involves protecting remaining native grassland, reducing further habitat fragmentation from roads and possibly restoring native prairies from existing cropland (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018). It has been the focus of a number of studies on the breeding grounds, but no species-specific management actions are in place. A multi-species action has been completed in southwestern Saskatchewan (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2016) and will be amended to include chestnut-collared longspur (Environment and Climate Change Canada. 2018).&#160;It is included in multi-species studies taking place on the wintering grounds in Chihuahua, Mexico (G. Butcher <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue monitoring the species. Identify key migration stopovers and wintering sites, and threats to these areas. Ascertain winter habitat requirements and preferences.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is predominantly sedentary or locally dispersive, but makes partially or fully migratory movements in the northern parts of its range due to its vulnerability to freezing conditions (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Most northern populations move south from September to December, returning again from March to May (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species breeds in solitary territorial pairs during the spring, especially during wet months (the exact timing varying geographically) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It remains largely solitary throughout the year although juveniles and adults may form diurnal feeding groups of up to 30 individuals in the winter, especially during hard weather (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), often congregating on sheltered lakes and ponds (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Habitat </strong>The species inhabits freshwater wetlands, both still and moving, requiring easy access to open water (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) and showing a preference for waters sheltered by woodland, bushes or tall emergent vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Suitable habitats include slow-flowing rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), oxbow lakes (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), streams, canals, ditches, lakes, reservoirs, sites with small open water surfaces such as pools and ponds only a few metres across, swamps, marshes (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), seasonally flooded sites (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) such as flood-plains (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), disused gravel pits, rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), sewage ponds (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), and occasionally mangroves (Puerto Rico)<strong></strong>. It generally avoids very open sites (especially those exposed to wind or wave action) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998) and oligotrophic or saline habitats (although it may be found on brackish waters) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). When foraging the species may range onto drier grassland, agricultural land or meadows, and on migration and in the winter months it can often be observed on damp grassland away from water (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). <strong><br/><br/>Diet </strong>The species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of earthworms, crustaceans, molluscs, adult and larval insects (especially flies, mayflies, caddisflies, bugs, beetles and Lepidoptera), spiders, small fish, tadpoles and occasionally birds eggs, as well as plant matter such as filamentous algae, moss, the vegetative parts of reeds and aquatic plants, the seeds of reeds, rushes, sedges, water-lilies, waterside herbaceous vegetation, trees (<em>Ulmus</em> spp.) and cereal crops, flowers of <em>Eichhornia</em> spp., and the berries and fruits of yew, <em>Rubus</em>, <em>Sorbus</em>, <em>Rosa</em>, <em>Crataegus</em>, <em>Rhamnus</em>, <em>Hedera</em>, <em>Sambucus</em>, <em>Hippophae</em> spp. and various orchard trees (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Breeding site </strong>The nest varies between a shallow saucer and a deep cup constructed from twigs and waterside vegetation, and can be floating on or positioned up to 1 m above water in emergent vegetation, or positioned on a solid platform of branches in water. Less often the nest is placed in ground vegetation or in low bushes on the bank near water, or in bushes and trees up to 8 m from the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Management information </strong>Early harvesting in rice-fields should be avoided as it harms nests and young broods of this species (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).","","The global   population is estimated to number over 2,000,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2014).","Stable","","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine","","Nearctic|Neotropical",NA,"false","false","Global",40,0,1,0

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Most of this species is fully migratory although it may only travel short distances (Kear 2005), and certain populations in the north-west of Europe may also be sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species breeds from April in solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), after which it undertakes short northerly moult migrations to coastal areas, large lakes and rivers (Kear 2005) to undergo a period of flightless moult lasting 3-4 weeks (males leave for this moult migration first while females are still incubating) (Scott and Rose 1996). Large moult gatherings are common during this period, males arriving at such gatherings in early-June and numbers peaking in late-August when adult females arrive (Scott and Rose 1996). The southward autumn migration begins in late-August with most arriving in the winter quarters by early-December (Scott and Rose 1996). Females tend to migrate further than males and juveniles migrate further than adults (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). The return migration to the breeding areas occurs as early as mid-February, the species timing its arrival to coincide with the thawing and appearance of open water (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). Non-breeders may also over-summer on wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is gregarious outside of the breeding season usually being observed in small scattered groups or in small flocks on migration (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Several hundred individuals may roost together (Snow and Perrins 1998) and large flocks often gather to feed at sewage outfalls (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) during the winter, although the species rarely occurs in very large flocks (Scott and Rose 1996). <br/><strong>Habitat </strong>The species is restricted to water close to the shore and less than 10 m deep, showing a preference for waters 4 m deep (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Breeding</em> When breeding the species shows a preference for oligotrophic lakes devoid of fish but with abundant invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005), and requires tree-holes (or artificial nestboxes) for nesting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Suitable habitats include freshwater lakes, pools, rivers and deep marshes surrounded by coniferous forest (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters mainly at sea on inshore waters, shallow bays, estuaries and coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005), especially in the vicinity of sewage outfalls (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Further to the south and on migration the species may also frequent large rivers, lakes and reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The diet of the species consists predominantly of aquatic invertebrates such as molluscs, worms, crustaceans, aquatic insects and insect larvae (e.g. dragonflies, damsel flies and may flies) (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), as well as amphibians, small fish and some plant material (mainly in the autumn) such as seeds, roots and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>The species nests in hollows of mature trees (e.g. aspen, spruce or oak) formed by woodpeckers or by bacterial or fungal heart-rot invasions that have internal cavity diameters of c.20 cm, although the height of the hollow does not seem to be important (Johnsgard 1978, Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005). The species will preferentially nest in trees in open stands near water or solitary trees on the edges of marshes, rather than in trees in dense stands in order to increase the ease of entry by flying (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988). The species will also nest in artificial nest-boxes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong><br/>Management information </strong>In Scotland, UK the introduction of a sewage treatment scheme in the Firth of Forth (a large marine bay) resulted in a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species, with feeding flocks only remaining at outfalls where sewage continued to be discharged in large quantities (Campbell 1984). It was unclear whether the changes in the species's distribution were due to reductions in the number of food items borne in the sewage or to reductions in aquatic invertebrate abundance as a result of the new treatment system (Campbell 1984). In some areas nestbox erection programmes have been shown to cause significant range expansions and population increases (Dennis 1987, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although an experiment in southern Finland found that even though nestbox provision increased breeding numbers of the species there was a negative density-dependent effect on reproductive output (i.e. the number of fledged young did not increase despite an increase in breeding pairs) (Poysa and Poysa 2002). Nesting habitats in general may also benefit from a more extended rotation of timber harvesting (Kear 2005).","<p>The species is threatened by wetland degradation and loss in North America and is susceptible to atmospheric acid deposition (e.g. acid rain) throughout a large part of its breeding range (Kear 2005). The main threat to the species in its wintering range is pollution, e.g. from coastal oil spills or other pollutants from sewage outfalls (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Modern forestry management work is also limiting the suitable area of breeding habitat by removing old and decaying trees with likely nest holes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The timber industry is thought to be compromising the population in large parts of the range. The placing of nest-boxes to compensate for the loss of natural nesting sites has not been very effective, as the species reaches an apparent density-dependent plateau in breeding success (Finland), which may indicate that nesting resource is not the primary limiting factor constraining the population. However, in other parts of the species' range (North America) use of nest-boxes has been found to increase the breeding range and productivity of Common Goldeneye. Historically, an estimated 100,000â250,000 were shot annually in north-west and central Europe. The species is still hunted at sustainable levels in Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006), while hunting elsewhere has unquantified effects on the global populations (Kear 2005), though not thought to drive any significant declines. Lead shot ingestion does not appear to be a significant risk, at least when compared to some other species of seaducks (Carboneras <em>et al.</em> 2014). The introduction of invertebrate-eating fish such as Perch, <em>Perca spp.</em>, to many lakes where they were not formerly present leads to increased resource competition which has been experimentally shown to negatively affect the Common Goldeneye (Nummi <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/></p>","The global   population is estimated to number c.2,700,000-4,700,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015). The Russian national population is estimated at c.100,000-1 million breeding pairs and   c.10,000 wintering individuals (Brazil 2009).&#160;The European population is estimated at 489,000-623,000 pairs, which equates to 977,000-1,250,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Stable","This species ranges across the boreal forests of Scandinavia, eastern Europe, <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Mongolia</strong>, northern <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Canada</strong>, Alaska and northern <strong>USA</strong>.

The species breeds from May onwards in isolated solitary pairs, nesting later further to the north depending on the timing of the snow melt (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992). Adults become flightless for a short time in late-winter when they moult their flight feathers (Godfrey 1979). During winter, the species occurs singly, in pairs or in small loose flocks in marine habitats, occasionally also forming large congregations of c.300 (Godfrey 1979, Snow and Perrins 1998, del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on large, deep freshwater lakes in coniferous forest or on open tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992). For nesting, it requires clear water with a visibility of at least 3-4 m and small islands (less than 2.5 ha) (Rimmer 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> It winters along the coast on exposed rocky shores, sheltered bays, channels and sheltered inlets,&#160; preferring shallow inshore waters (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992, Rimmer 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also be found inland on lakes and reservoirs during this season, although this is largely influenced by the weather (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992, Rimmer 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic insects, annelid worms, frogs, other amphibians<strong></strong>and plant matter (e.g. <em>Potamogeton</em> spp., willow <em>Salix</em> spp. shoots, roots, seeds, moss and algae) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a mound of plant matter screened by vegetation and placed near the water's edge on islands, islets or promontories (del Hoyo <em>et al</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998).","Relatively high levels of mortality from commercial gillnets have been recorded, e.g. in Chesapeake Bay, 21% of birds killed were this species (Forsell 1999) and bycatch appears relatively frequent in the great lakes, with up to 50 caught in a single net in a week (Evers <em>et al.</em> 2010). This indicates the potential for significant indiscriminate mortality, though this may be an extreme example and efforts to improve fishing gear to reduce this bycatch have been generally effective (Carey 1993). May also be vulnerable to human disturbance and pollution of inland breeding lakes.","Wetlands International (2016) estimated the population at 612,000-640,000 individuals. In Europe the breeding population is estimated at 700-1,300 pairs, which equates to 1,400-2,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Stable","This species breeds in much of <strong>Canada</strong> and Alaska, parts of northern <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, southern parts of Greenland (to <strong>Denmark</strong>) and in <strong>Iceland</strong>. It winters on coasts or on larger lakes over a much wider area including the Atlantic coast of Europe from <strong>Finland</strong> to <strong>Portugal</strong> and the western Mediterranean, the Atlantic coast of North America down to northern <strong>Mexico</strong>, and the Pacific coast of North America from northern Mexico to the tip of Alaska (U.S.A.)

It is listed in Article I under the EU Birds Directive. In Europe, it occurs in 20 IBAs, including in Iceland, Norway (Svalbard and mainland Norway), Ireland, the United Kingdom and in Spain. It is a listed species in 83 Special Protection Areas in the EU Natura 2000 network.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Protect Important Bird Areas across range states and identify and designate additional important sites.

Develop rapid and trans-boundary response plans to coastal oil spills. There is evidence that introducing floating nesting platforms on lakes  is successful in increasing the reproductive success of the species  (Piper <em>et al.</em> 2002), and that nest losses caused by flooding  can be reduced by controlling water levels during the nesting period  (Rimmer 1992). Mortality from entanglement and drowning in fishing nets  could also be reduced by using fish traps with openings at the top to  allow birds to escape, or by checking traps more regularly for captured  birds (Rimmer 1992).","Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic",NA,"false","false","Global",0,0,0,0

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Northern breeding populations of this species are fully migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998) although breeders in temperate regions are sedentary or only travel short distances (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). The species arrives on its breeding areas between March and May (Scott and Rose 1996), actually breeding as early as late-March (although often considerably later in more northerly regions) (Madge and Burn 1988). It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) of up to 8-10 individuals (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) (especially on islands that provide suitable nesting sites in lacustrine or coastal locations) (Johnsgard 1978). The males gather to moult after mating, often undertaking considerable moult migrations to flock on key waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Females also undergo a post-breeding moult on the breeding grounds during which they become flightless for around 1 month (Johnsgard 1978). The main migration to wintering areas largely occurs from October through to December (Scott and Rose 1996), mass departures being linked to the freezing of breeding and moulting areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species is typically found in small parties, with groups of up to 70 individuals feeding together on shoals of fish during the winter (Kear 2005). Large flocks may also form on roosting waters (Madge and Burn 1988), the largest gatherings occurring during the autumn migration and winter months and numbering up to several thousands of individuals (Madge and Burn 1988) (1,000 to 10,000 on suitable waters) (Snow and Perrins 1998). On passage in the spring flocks are usually small however, with breeding pairs remaining in flocks until they reach the breeding grounds (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on large clear freshwater lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005), pools (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), the upper reaches of rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005) and streams (Kear 2005) in the boreal, montane (Kear 2005) and temperate forest zones (Johnsgard 1978). It requires waters with a fairly high productivity of fish (Kear 2005) surrounded by mature hard-wood trees with holes excavated by woodpeckers or natural cavities for nesting in (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters on large unfrozen lakes, rivers, lagoons, brackish waters and marshes (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), generally avoiding highly saline waters (Madge and Burn 1988) although it may move to estuaries, coastal lagoons and sheltered sea coasts with waters less than 10 m deep in particularly harsh winters (Scott and Rose 1996). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) less than 10 cm long (Kear 2005), but may also include aquatic invertebrates (such as molluscs, crustaceans, worms, and adult and larval insects), amphibians, small mammals and birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The species nests in holes excavated by large woodpeckers or natural cavities in mature hardwood trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005) with entry holes more than 15 m above the ground (Kear 2005). It shows a preference for cavities with openings c.12 cm wide and internal diameters of c.25 cm (Johnsgard 1978) in trees close to or up to 1 km away from water (Snow and Perrins 1998). When natural tree-nesting sites are not available (Johnsgard 1978) the species will use artificial nestboxes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005) or may nest among tree roots in undercut banks, on cliff ledges (Kear 2005), in rock clefts (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984) or in dense scrub or loose boulders on islands (Kear 2005). Sometimes several females may nest in the same tree (Madge and Burn 1988), especially on islands that provide suitable nesting sites in lacustrine or coastal locations (Johnsgard 1978). <strong>Management information </strong>Artificial nestboxes commonly used are 85-100 cm high with openings 50-60 cm from the base (Johnsgard 1978).","<p>The species is subject to persecution by anglers and fish-farmers who perceive it as a competitor and accuse it of depleting their fish stocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Eradication efforts may lead to long-term depression of Goosander populations (with little improvement in fish survival rates) (Pearce <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species suffers occasional entrapment in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm, with records of bycatch from China (Quan <em>et al.</em> 2002). The species is also at risk from degradation of freshwater lakes resulting from drainage and petroleum pollution in Russia (Grishanov 2006) and acid rain in North America (Kear 2005). The species is susceptible to avian influenza and is at risk from future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Hunting occurs in North America (Kear 2005) and Russia (Grishanov 2006), but the Goosander is not a popular game bird (Kear 2005). Its eggs used to be, and possibly still are, harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979). Present harvesting levels are sufficiently low not to be driving declines.</p>","The global population is estimated to number c.1,700,000-2,400,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 66,800-103,000 pairs, which equates to 134,000-206,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Unknown","This species can be found breeding year-round in central Asia and western <strong>China</strong>, in northern Europe including <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong>, Scandinavia, the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> and <strong>Iceland</strong>, and in large areas of northern <strong>United States</strong> and parts of southern <strong>Canada</strong>.

It generally occupies more open habitat in the south and  north portions of range where cliffs, sparse trees and human structures provide nest  locations. In middle latitudes it is generally found in coniferous and  broadleaf forests, where tree-nesting often more common than  cliff-nesting. It is abundant in temperate (coniferous) rainforest along the north Pacific coast of North America. It generally avoids large cities but is abundant in Anchorage, Alaska and locally abundant in California metropolitan areas (Marzluff 2009). Egg-laying begins in late February  over most of its range, although further north in Greenland and Siberia  it begins later in April (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a large and  bulky platform, made from dead sticks, lined with fine roots, grass,  string and other bits of rubbish, and with mammal fur to make an inner  cup. It is placed in the stout, lower branches of a tree, on a steep  cliff, or on an artificial structure such as a utility pole, building,  sign, radio tower, abandoned vehicle, oil derrick, bridge, irrigation  pipe or windmill. Clutch size is typically four to six eggs. It is an  opportunistic scavenger, consuming a huge variety of animals and plants.  It preys on adult and nestling birds, eggs, small mammals, sick and  dying larger mammals, toads, snakes, juvenile turtles, fish and  invertebrates. It also scavenges garbage and slaughterhouse offal, dung,  and nearly any kind of carrion and some plant matter is also consumed  (Marzluff 2009). The species is mostly sedentary but northern  populations are liable to move south in winter (Hagemeijer and Blair  1997).","From mid-1600s to mid-1900s or later this species was widely persecuted  due to fear and superstition, resulting in European populations being  reduced, often to point of creating gaps in the species's distribution  (e.g. throughout much northern and central Europe). Persecution still  continues in Iceland and Greenland but throughout the rest of Europe it  is much reduced, allowing the species to recolonize areas it was  previously extirpated from. Increasing populations of this species in much of western U.S.A. have led to conflict and targeted killing campaigns with large numbers shot and poisoned in California, Oregon, Utah and Nevada with limited and short-term benefits to crops and other wildlife (Marzluff 2009). Currently, intensive  farming, the removal of woodland and human disturbance may also affect the  species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","The global population is estimated to number &gt; c.16,000,000 individuals (Rich <em>et al</em>. 2004). The European population is estimated at 611,000-1,160,000 pairs, which equates to 1,220,000-2,320,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Increasing","","","Terrestrial","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Active reintroduction  efforts and increased subsidization, have aided its return to parts of  Germany, the Netherlands, south-east U.S.A.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is fully migratory, although the extent of migration varies between populations. Some populations, e.g. in Spain, remain predominantly sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Autumn movements are often protracted, with dispersal beginning in mid-August and lasting until late-November (peaking in October). The return migration begins in March (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species's migratory movements are mainly nocturnal, although diurnal migration is known in the Palearctic (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It breeds between May and June in the Northern Hemisphere (although laying dates often vary extensively between years and lakes), and nests in reed swamps in colonies of up to 2000 nests, although it may also nest in isolated pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). It forages diurnally (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004) and is highly gregarious, both on migration and during the winter, forming concentrations of hundreds of thousands at certain sites in North America and Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). After arrival at autumn staging grounds (e.g. Mono Lake in California) the species becomes flightless for 3 to 4 months due to loss of weight from the pectoral muscles (Ogilvie and Rose 2003). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season the species frequents permanent and temporary small, shallow, highly eutrophic pools with lush vegetation, such as freshwater marshes and lakes with dispersed submergent vegetation and patches of reeds, as well as ponds and fish ponds, sewage farms, quiet river backwaters and newly flooded areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Konter 2001, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). In southern Russia and Kazakhstan, it shows a preference for variably developed reed swamps and gypsotrophic lakes (alkaline waters with rich submergent vegetation such as <em>Chara</em> and <em>Potamogeton</em> <em>pectinatus</em>) (FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species moves to salt lakes, hyper-saline industrial evaporation ponds and reservoirs, or to coastal estuaries, arms of the sea, and inshore shallows in bays and channels (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004).&#160;<strong>Diet</strong> The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting of adult and larval insects (such as aquatic bugs, terrestrial and aquatic beetles, damselflies, dragonflies, midges and brine-flies), molluscs, crustaceans (e.g. brine shrimps), amphibians (e.g. small frogs and tadpoles), nereid worms, snails and small fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Konter 2001, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). <strong>Breeding site</strong> It usually nests colonially in thinly spaced, emergent marsh vegetation (such as <em>Scirpus, Typha </em>or sedge <em>Carex</em>), or on dense mats of floating waterweed, sometimes far from the shore (FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004). The nest is a floating platform of aquatic vegetation anchored to emergent vegetation such as reeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, FjeldsÃ¥&#160;2004).","Sporadic episodes of catastrophic mortality in the Salton Sea, which have been as large as 150,000 individuals (around 6% of the North American population) in 1991-1992 (Meteyer <em>et al.</em> 2004), appear to be driven by both gradual and episodic reductions in the population of pileworms, the primary prey source available to grebes in the winter (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2007). These reductions are likely due to an increase in salinity of the lake reducing overall pileworm productivity and increasing water column stratification. This results in the production of anoxic conditions with high sulphide levels in deeper water, subsequent weather-mediated mixing events bring this water to the surface, killing pileworms and resulting in the death of grebes too weak to move onto better wintering grounds by starvation (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2007). Populations have also been known to crash in winter habitats during El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation events due to reductions in food availability due to warming sea-surface temperatures, although they rebound to previous levels afterwards (Jehl <em>et al.</em> 2002).","The global population is estimated to number c.3,900,000-4,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 46,400-77,500 pairs, which equates to 92,800-155,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Unknown","This species is found on every continent except Australasia and Antarctica. It can be found from Europe to western Asia and in central and eastern Asia, wintering in the south-west Palearctic, east Asia and east Africa.

It requires cavity nest-sites, typically in woodland or on man-made structures, close to open areas of short grassland for foraging. At other times, it exploits a wide range of habitats, including moorland, saltmarshes, seashore and tidal flats, stubble fields, orchards, refuse dumps and sewage-treatment works. It roosts in reedbeds, scrub and trees, as well as bridges and buildings and even in town centres.&#160;<br/><br/>Breeding occurs mostly between March and July. The nest is a bulky structure of dry grass, conifer needles, twigs, string and other materials and the cup is lined with softer materials such as grass, feathers, moss, wool, hair and paper, fresh green leaves and flowers. It is typically built in a hole in a tree, cliff, building or other structure and nestboxes are also readily used. Clutches normally consist of four to six eggs (Craig and Feare 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Common Starling is omnivorous, taking animal and plant material all year round, but during the spring animal food predominates and is fed almost exclusively to nestlings (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<br/><br/>The northern and eastern populations are migratory, whereas southern and western populations as well as those in urban areas tend to be resident (Craig and Feare 2015).","The species is thought to be declining in some areas owing to the intensification and specialization of agriculture and subsequent changes in rural habitats (Craig and Feare 2015), such as decreases in fallow and grassland and increases in autumn-sown arable crops (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is strongly migratory in the north of its range (Kear 2005b) although breeding populations in temperate regions are largely sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Males leave the breeding grounds in early-July (one month before the females and young), migrating to key waters to undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for c.4 weeks, after which they continue to the wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). The return migration occurs from March to April (Scott and Rose 1996), and although the timing of the breeding season varies geographically the species generally nests late in the year (e.g. May-July) (Kear 2005b). It breeds in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and is usually observed in small parties outside of the breeding season, with large concentrations sometimes forming on passage (Madge and Burn 1988) or during the moulting period (Kear 2005b)  (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits highly productive (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005b) and eutrophic (Snow and Perrins 1998) freshwater marsh or lake habitats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005b) in open lowland grassland (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988), showing a preference for sheltered, shallow, standing or slow-flowing waters (Snow and Perrins 1998) with abundant emergent vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005b) and grass-covered islands providing cover for nesting (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also be found on permanent, shallow, slightly alkaline marshes (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), as well as on oxbow lakes, channels (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), reservoirs and gravel-pits (Kear 2005b). After hatching, females move their broods to deeper marshes or to the edges of large impoundments, sometimes more than 1 mile away from the nesting sites (Johnsgard 1978). Rarely (e.g. in the winter) (Madge and Burn 1988) the species occurs along sheltered coasts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996) at coastal marshes (North America) (Kear 2005b), estuaries (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), deltas or lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is predominantly herbivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), its diet consisting of the seeds, leaves, roots and stems of aquatic plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (submerged and emergent) as well as grasses and stoneworts <em>Chara</em> spp. (Kear 2005b), occasionally also taking cereal grains on land (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). In addition, the species may take a small amount of animal matter during the winter (Africa), such as insects, molluscs, annelids, amphibians, amphibian spawn and small fish (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a well-hidden (Johnsgard 1978) hollow (Snow and Perrins 1998) in grass and leaves positioned on the ground in thick vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as nettles <em>Urtica</em> spp. (Madge and Burn 1988), grass tussocks, thick bushes, rushes or tall grass (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species shows a preference for dense, dry herbaceous vegetation (Johnsgard 1978) and often nests far from water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). It may nest in dense concentrations on islands (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b) (neighbouring nests as close as 5 m apart) (Snow and Perrins 1998) although it is not a colonial species (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). <strong>Management information</strong> The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK (leaving small fish for piscivorous birds) resulted in an increase in the winter use of the habitat by the species as result of an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).  <p></p>","The species is threatened by pollution (Kear 2005b) and disturbance from recreational use of freshwater wetlands (Kear 2005b, Pease <em>et al.</em> 2005). It also suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (Spain) (Mondain-Monval <em>et al.</em> 2002) and nest predation by American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> (Europe) (Opermanis <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Melville and Shortridge 2006). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted throughout most of its range (Kear 2005b) both for recreation (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006, Shortridge <em>et al.</em> 2006) and commercial uses (Balmaki and Barati 2006), but is rarely taken in large numbers except where it is particularly abundant (Kear 2005b).

In addition northern breeding populations are fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and may travel on a broad front (e.g. across the Sahara) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Northern and southern breeding populations breed during the local spring, whilst breeding elsewhere coincides with the rains (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species nests in mixed-species colonies, either in small groups (e.g. 5-100 pairs in Africa) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) or in large aggregations of thousands of pairs, and during the winter or dry seasons the species usually forages in small flocks (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) of up to 30 indivduals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). It often roosts communally at night in large groups (sometimes thousands of individuals) with other species, occasionally in trees far from wetland feeding sites (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species feeds in very shallow water (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) and nests in freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes) and low trees or bushes (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It shows a preference for marshes at the edges of lakes and rivers (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), as well as lagoons, flood-plains, wet meadows (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), swamps (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), reservoirs (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), sewage ponds, rice-fields and irrigated cultivation (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It less often occurs in coastal locations such as estuaries, deltas, saltmarshes (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) and coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Roosting sites are often large trees that may be far from water (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> The diet of the species varies seasonally depending on what is available (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It takes adult and larval insects (e.g. aquatic beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and caddisflies), worms, leeches, molluscs (e.g. snails and mussels), crustaceans (e.g. crabs and crayfish) and occasionally fish, frogs, tadpoles, lizards, small snakes and nestling birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a platform of twigs and vegetation usually positioned less than 1 m above water (occasionally up to 7 m) in tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes), low trees or bushes over water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) through drainage (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992) for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian <em>et al</em>. 2002), clearing, grazing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It is also threatened locally by hunting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998), disturbance and pesticides (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global population is estimated at 230,000-2,220,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 28,300-37,700 pairs, which equates to 56,500-75,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<p><strong>Behaviour</strong>&#160; This is the most widespread of the <em>Aquila</em> eagles, ranging across the Nearctic and Palearctic (70Â°N<strong> </strong>to 20Â°S), and fringing Indomalaya and the Afrotropics. It is uncommon to scarce across its range. In general, the species is sedentary, with juveniles dispersing as far as 1000km in their first few years. Birds occupying the mostly northerly regions (&gt;65Â°N), such as Alaska, northern Canada, Fennoscandia and northern Russia, migrate south. In the Nearctic there are southwards movements to southern Alaska and southwest USA in September, via regular flyways, in particular through southwest Alberta. In the Palearctic, movements occur in a broad front to wintering areas in southeast Europe, the Russian steppes, Mongolia, northern China and Japan. Juveniles and immatures will go as far as North Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Habitat </strong>The species occupies a wide range of flat or mountainous, largely open habitats, often above the tree line, from sea level to 4000m. In the Himalayas it has been recorded as high as 6200m (Watson, 2010).<strong> Diet </strong>The speciesâs diet is very broad, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and carrion variously, depending on the regional prey availability. Prey taken are usually 0.5-4.0 kg and the species can hunt in pairs or small groups (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Breeding Site </strong>Nesting occurs on cliff ledges and where these are not available, in large trees or similar artificial structures. In central and southeastern Mongolia, birds regularly nest on the ground (Ellis 2020). Nests are constructed from sticks and are added to in successive years, growing to 2m in diameter. The breeding season spans March â August throughout the majority of its range, and in southern areas begins as early as November; whilst in the most northerly regions it will start as late as April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).</p>","The species was heavily persecuted in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, and although this threat has diminished significantly with populations now generally stable, the species is still deliberately poisoned, shot and trapped (for example in landscapes dominated by grouse moors in Scotland [RSPB 2017]). In the past the species was affected by the use of organochlorine pesticides although this is not a significant problem today. There are, however, recent reports of high exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in the USA (Niedringhaus <em>et al. </em>2021). The relationship between stock grazing and Golden Eagle populations is complex - both undergrazing as a result of grassland abandonment and overgrazing have been reported as threats by various European countries (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Electrocution from power lines has been reported as one of the primary causes of anthropogenic mortality in North America - Golden Eagles regularly perch on distribution poles supporting energised equipment (Dwyer <em>et al. </em>2020), and the USFWS (2016) estimated that 504 Golden Eagles are electrocuted annually. Wind energy developments are a source of direct mortality for the species, particularly in California where wandering sub-adults are mostly affected (Watson 2010).&#160; Future developments in flyways may affect migrating adult eagles, and locally may cause effective habitat loss and lead to collisions (Katzner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012b). In addition, afforestation, long term changes in food supply, including reduced livestock carrion through changing management practices, and climate change (for example drought [Smith <em>et al. </em>2020]) may threaten the species in future (Watson 2010). Within the Mediterranean region, declines in rabbit populations as a result of Viral Haemorrhagic Pneumonia may have a negative effect on productivity (FernÃ¡ndez 1993).","The Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020a) estimate the global population to be 130,000 individuals, which equates to approximately 87,100 mature individuals. The European population is estimated at 9,600-12,800 pairs, which equates to 19,200-25,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).&#160;Europe forms approximately 16% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 120,000-160,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

Populations breeding in the tropics are sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or partially migratory (in relation to rainfall) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), whereas Palearctic and Nearctic populations are migratory (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The timing of the breeding season varies geographically (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although temperate breeders tend to nest in the spring and summer (e.g. April to July) and tropical breeders nest in the part of the rain cycle when food becomes maximally available (this may be during the rains or in the dry season) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species typically breeds in colonies of tens, hundreds or even a thousand pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), sometimes with other species (e.g. 450 pairs in a mixed colony of over 3,000 nests in Australia) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Some populations also show a tendency to breed solitarily or in small groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Outside of the breeding season the species may feed solitarily (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or in small loose groups (Marchant and Higgins 1990) (e.g. of 12-50 individuals) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), although flocks of hundreds or more individuals may form where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) but is most active at dawn and dusk (although in coastal environments it feeding habits are determined by tidal stages) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and roosts at night in trees (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) alongside lakes or rivers or in mangroves, often with other species (Langrand 1990). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits all kinds of inland and coastal wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although it is mainly found along the coast in the winter (e.g. in the Palearctic Region) (Snow and Perrins 1998) or during droughts (e.g. in Australia) (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It frequents river margins, lakes shores, marshes, flood-plains (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), oxbows, streams (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields, drainage ditches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), aquaculture ponds, reservoirs (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and sewage works (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) inland, and the shallows of salt-lakes (Marchant and Higgins 1990), saltpans, mudflats, coastal swamps, mangroves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), saltmarshes, seagrass flats, offshore coral reefs, lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries when in coastal locations (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> In aquatic habitats its diet consists of fish, amphibians, snakes, aquatic insects and crustaceans although in drier habitats terrestrial insects, lizards, small birds and mammals are more commonly taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed from sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and vegetation (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and is normally positioned over water at a height of 1-15 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) in reedbeds, bamboos (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes, trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. willow <em>Salix</em> spp.)<strong>, </strong>mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and other plants near water or on islands in sites that are protected from ground predators (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups where nests may be less than 1 m apart or touching, although they are usually placed more spread out in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding pairs may also reuse nests from previous years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Management information </strong>Breeding site conservation should include colony protection, control of disturbance and vegetation management, and the conservation of feeding areas should include the management of hydrology, salt intrusion, contaminants and disturbance (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). An artificial island nesting site created in the Camargue, France succeeded in attracting nesting pairs to the area (Hafner 2000).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) for example through drainage, grazing, clearing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Breeding colonies in Madagascar may be declining due to egg and chick gathering from colonies by local people (Langrand 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and the species previously suffered from intense persecution for the plume trade (this is no longer a threat) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).","Estimate includes totals for '<em>Ardea modesta</em>'.&#160;The European population of A. alba is estimated at 20,700-34,900 pairs, which equates to 41,500-69,900 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Unknown","","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's European range only: Breeding site conservation should include colony protection, control of disturbance and vegetation management, and the conservation of feeding areas should include the management of hydrology, salt intrusion, contaminants and disturbance (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> The majority of this species is sedentary, although northern breeding populations are migratory and African populations may perform local movements relating to seasonal rainfall (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). The timing of breeding varies geographically, but often occurs during the rains in the tropics (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is highly territorial and often forages and nests singly, occasionally also nesting in loosely spaced single-species groups of 5-15 pairs or even in larger breeding aggregations of several hundred pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> The species shows a preference for forested water margins such as mangrove-lined shores and estuaries, or dense woody vegetation fringing ponds, rivers, lakes and streams (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Other suitable habitats include river swamps, canals, artificial ponds, salt-flats, mudflats, tidal zones, exposed coral reefs, reedbeds, grassy marshland, pastures, rice-fields and other flooded cultivation (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet varies considerably over its range, but usually consists predominantly of fish as well as amphibians (e.g. frogs), insects (e.g. water beetles, grasshoppers and dragonflies), spiders, leeches, crustaceans (e.g. crabs and prawns), molluscs, earthworms, polychaete worms, birds, small reptiles and mice (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a small, shallow structure of twigs placed well hidden amongst the branches of trees or bushes (especially mangroves <em>Rhizophora</em> spp. and <em>Avicennia</em> spp., or <em>Allocasuarina</em> spp., <em>Myoporum</em> spp., <em>Callistemon</em> spp., <em>Hibiscus</em> spp., <em>Casuarina</em> spp., <em>Syzygium</em> spp.<em> </em>and <em>Inga </em>spp.) 0.3-10 m above the surface of water or above the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","The species is threatened by human disturbance, pesticides and habitat destruction, e.g. the loss of mangroves (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).<strong> </strong>The species is taken for food in some areas (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","The global   population has not been quantified given recent taxonomic changes. The last population estimate, from Wetlands International (2021), is 260,000-2,300,000 individuals in total, which equates to roughly 173,000-1,500,000 mature individuals.

Throughout its range, it prefers mainly barren terrain with very short vegetation. In Eurasia, it breeds mainly in arctic tundra, dry stony patches in lichen tundra, barren steppes and arctic-alpine zones. It also occupies open coasts and dunes in the non-breeding season. In western Europe, migrants of the subspecies<em> flava&#160;</em>are largely confined to open coastal habitats around the North Sea in winter. In North America, Horned Lark is widely distributed across most open habitats from sea-level up to c.4,000 m. In the Andes, the subspecies <em>peregrina</em> uses short-grass pastureland and bare fields to at least 3,100 m. <br/>In Eurasia, Horned Lark breeds from late May to mid-July in Scandinavia, but from mid-June in Arctic Russia. In North America, it breeds from mid-February in southern USA and from mid-May in the Canadian Arctic. The female builds the nest in an excavated cavity or natural depression on the ground, which is filled with woven plant material, lined with feathers or other fine material and has stones, bark, clods of earth, animal dung and other materials placed around it. The nest is usually positioned to reduce wind flow across it to as little as a tenth of ambient wind speed and to maximize shade. Clutches consist of one to eight eggs, but mostly two to five, although clutch size increases with latitude. <br/>Horned Lark feeds on a wide range of invertebrates in summer and plant material in winter. Nestlings are fed almost entirely with invertebrates. <br/>The species is migratory or partially migratory in the north and mostly resident or an altitudinal migrant in the south. Across the Holarctic Region, subspecies in the far north are wholly migratory, with much or all of breeding range abandoned in winter. In the south of the range, Horned Lark is an altitudinal migrant (Donald and de Juana 2014).","In Europe, drastic declines were noted since 1950s in northern Fennoscandia, especially Finland, which were believed to be due to overgrazing of lichen by reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>) (Donald and de Juana 2014). The subspecies <em>peregrina </em>in the Colombian Andes is threatened by the introduced Kikuyu Grass (<em>Cenchrus clandestinus</em>), unfavourable agricultural practices and unrestricted use of pesticides. In North America, changes in agriculture are considered a threat, including the replacement of arable crops by biomass-fuel production and the change from conventional tillage to minimum tillage. Agricultural abandonment and direct poisoning by pesticides are also considered threats (Donald and de Juana 2014).","Partners in Flight estimate the global population to number 140,000,000 mature individuals (A. Panjabi <em>in litt</em>. 2017).&#160;The European population is estimated at 2,140,000-6,510,000 pairs, which equates to 4,280,000-13,000,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population sizes have been   estimated at 100-10,000 breeding pairs, 50-1,000 individuals on migration   and 50-1,000 wintering individuals in China as well as &lt;1,000 individuals on   migration and &lt;1,000 wintering individuals in Japan (Brazil 2009).","Decreasing","","","Terrestrial|Marine","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Bern Convention Appendix II.

In  the south of its range it is more frequently found in open country, and  has been recorded as breeding in small isolated colonies away from  humans. In Central Asia and Afghanistan, the species is mainly a summer visitor, where it is confined to open country in the area of overlap with resident <em>P. montanus</em>; farther north, in Siberia, the two species live side by  side in built-up areas. It breeds from February to September, although timing varies  with latitude. It breeds in loose colonies and nests are constructed  mainly of plant stems, lined with feathers or other soft material. Its  preferred site is a hole in a building, cliff or tree. Clutches are two  to five eggs. The diet is mainly vegetable material, particularly seeds  of grasses, cultivated cereals and low herbs, but also buds, berries and  wide range of household scraps. It does take some animal matter (c. 10%  of the diet in summer months). The species is mostly resident with some limited withdrawal of populations breeding at high latitudes and altitudes to less cold areas in winter  (Summers-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Declines in western Europe have been attributed to a decrease in  availability of suitable invertebrate food necessary for rearing young  as well as possible reduced fitness of those young that fledge  successfully (Summers-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015). This may be as a result of  changes in agricultural practices such as the increased use of  pesticides and herbicides and the autumn sowing of cereals, which have  lead to decreases in food for this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","Rich <em>et al. </em>(2004) estimated the global population at &gt; c.540,000,000 individuals. However, the European population is estimated at 134,000,000-196,000,000 pairs,  which equates to 269,000,000-392,000,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms approximately 30% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 896,000,000-1,310,000,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. National population sizes have been estimated at c.100-100,000 breeding pairs in China and c.100-100,000 breeding pairs in Russia (Brazil 2009).","Decreasing","<em>Passer domesticus</em> has an extremely large range and occurs in most parts of the world.","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species was  Red-listed in the U.K. in 2002 and listed as Near-threatened in Germany  as a result of declines (Summers-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The  conservation and habitat enhancement of even the smallest parks and  gardens may be key in addressing the decline of this species in many  cities (Summers-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Afrotropical|Antarctic|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic",NA,"false","false","Global",60,0,1,0

Therefore, it is listed as Near Threatened.","This species occupies a variety of habitats generally associated with open areas and short vegetation (Yosef and International Shrike Working Group&#160;2017). This includes parkland, pastures, open woodland, orchards and agricultural land with hedgerows and perching sites (such as fences) and impaling sites for storing food (e.g. barbed wire or vegetation with thorns/spines) (Yosef 1996, Yosef and International Shrike Working Group 2017). Shrike habitat typically includes four 'common elements': 1) foraging areas, typically bare ground and exposed rock, 2) nesting sites, usually small trees and shrubs, 3) perching sites, and 4) impaling sites, often barbed wire, thorns of sharp branches (Pruitt 2000, A. Chabot <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species typically feeds on arthropods, amphibians, and small mammals, birds and reptiles, such as the&#160;<em>Thamnophis sirtalis infernalis</em> (Hughes 2019, Yosef 2020).","Several ideas have been presented that may account for declines in this species (see Lymn and Temple 1991), including pesticides (Anderson and Duzan 1978), fire ant presence in wintering habitats (Lymn and Temple 1991), West Nile Virus (Bertelsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Smallwood and Nakomoto 2009) and habitat fragmentation and loss, particularly through conversion to agricultural land. The Loggerhead Shrike has been evidenced to be significantly more abundant in better connected areas of suitable habitat (Froehly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) whilst occupancy significantly increases in areas with greater than 15-25% habitat suitability (A. Chabot <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Migratory connectivity is known to be greater in western <em>L. ludovicianus</em>&#160;populations where the impacts of habitat loss on populations are thought to be reduced, hence western populations may be at comparatively less risk than eastern populations (Chabot <em>et al</em>. 2018). Habitat loss and fragmentation are therefore thought to only be of regional significance, hence in other locations additional factors must be responsible for limiting Loggerhead Shrikes and driving the witnessed declines (Brooks and Temple 1990, Froehly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;The species may have also been persecuted and shot in the past, but this has likely reduced (Yosef 1996).&#160;While the use of certain pesticides is now prohibited in U.S.A. the potential effects of other threats may be likely to continue into the future (Pruitt 2000, COSEWIC 2014). Collisions with vehicles contribute to the species's decline as roads display a number of essential habitat features; 29% of all <em>L. ludovicianus</em>&#160;winter mortality in Virginia has been attributed to collisions on roads (Blumton 1989). Furthermore, intraspecific competition on wintering grounds between migrants and resident shrikes that occupy territories year round likely contributes to the decline of obligant migrant populations of Loggerhead Shrike in north-eastern North America (Brooks and Temple 1990; Cade and Woods 1997; Pruitt 2000; COSEWIC 2000). Loss of habitat in wintering areas may exacerbate competition (Lymn and Temple 1991).&#160;Extreme local weather conditions have been implicated in declines as a result of high nest failure rates (e.g., nest abandonment or loss of young birds during cold wet breeding seasons, especially with heavy rains [Pruitt 2000]) and such threats may increase as stormy conditions are exacerbated under a changing global climate (COSEWIC 2014, Environment Canada 2015a).&#160;Predation of shrikes by a variety of species, including cats, raccoons, crows, magpies, and several raptors has been observed (Blumton 1989; Wiggins 2004) but the significance has not been evaluated. Predation by feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) impacts the endemic subspecies <em>L. l. mearnsi</em>&#160;on San Clemente Island, California, U.S.A. (Gustafson <em>et al</em>. 2020).","Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population to total 7,000,000 mature individuals.","Decreasing","This species is a widespread breeder across much of the <strong>U.S.A. </strong>and <strong>Mexico</strong>, extending into southern <strong>Canada </strong>in the breeding season. Northern populations are migratory whereas those in the south of the range are generally resident (Froehly <em>et al</em>. 2019).","","Terrestrial","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong>The Loggerhead Shrike is&#160;protected in Canada, Mexico, and the USA under the Migratory Birds Convention Act (COSEWIC 2014).&#160;Under Canadaâs Species at Risk Act, the Prairie subspecies (<em>L. l. excubitorides</em>) is currently listed as Threatened, while the Eastern subspecies (<em>L. l. migrans</em>) is listed as Endangered (COSEWIC 2014). The species was incorporated into the Canadian Wildlife Service's Operation Grasslands Community (Yosef 1996) whilst a targeted recovery strategy was developed and implemented in 2015 for subspecies <em>migrans</em>&#160;in Canada, aimed at re-establishing a viable population of the subspecies in Canada where less than 100 wild individuals remain (Environment Canada 2015a). This species has been&#160;successfully reared in captivity with captive-reared juveniles released to augment populations in Ontario and Quebec (as well as San Clemente Island, California); over 400 juveniles released between 2001-2010 with ~76% of such individuals thought to survive from release to migration initiation (Imlay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Nichols&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Lagios&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). A species recovery plan also exists for subspecies <em>excubitorides</em>&#160;in Canada (Environment Canada 2015b) whilst the subspecies is included in multi-species action plans for&#160;southwestern Saskatchewan (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2017) and the Grasslands National Park (Parks Canada Agency 2016). The North American Loggerhead Shrike Working Group was established in 2013 to undertake 'multi-jurisdictional research and conservation efforts for Loggerhead Shrike and their habitat', guided by the&#160;Loggerhead Shrike Conservation Action Plan&#160;(Loggerhead Shrike Working Group 2017). Accomplishments so far include a&#160;tri-national colour banding program, predictive occupancy and distribution modelling, developing standardised&#160;protocols for shrike surveys and monitoring, and broad-scale surveys and monitoring through the community science program, 'Shrike Force' (Loggerhead Shrike Working Group 2017, J. Steiner <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Banding and radio-tagging is underway in Mexico to explore local movements and habitat utilisation (J. Steiner <em>in litt</em>. 2020). This species has been&#160;successfully reared in captivity with  captive-reared juveniles released to augment populations on San Clemente  Island, California and in Ontario, Canada (Imlay <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nichols <em>et al</em>. 2010, Lagios <em>et al</em>.  2015) and this action is considered significant in securing the  long-term persistence and re-establishment of Loggerhead Shrike  populations, particularly throughout the north-eastern portion of its  range (L. Steiner&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong>Monitor the species to get clear estimates of population size and trends across its range. Investigate any possible further threats to this species that could be contributing to population declines, including investigating whether other pesticides could be affecting the species and how the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on the species varies regionally (Environment Canada 2015a).

It generally prefers to nest in large open expanses of relatively low vegetation, and is late maturing, long-lived and has a low reproductive output. In winter it favours intertidal habitats but will feed in adjacent pastures (Leeman and Colwell 2005).
</P>","Sea-level rise may reduce the amount of available intertidal wintering habitat in future (Colwell and Mathis 2001). The loss and conversion of large areas of short grass prairie into agricultural land within its range has presumably had a major impact upon the species and is likely to the most important threat at present. Long-billed Curlew are facing increasing threats in the grasslands and prairies of North America, both on their breeding and wintering grounds. In addition, Long-billed Curlew range contractions on the eastern edge of their range continue to cause concerns.","Continental populations were thought to be declining by 2% per year between 1980 and 1996 (equivalent to 16% in ten years) (AOU 1998, Hill 1998); however data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey indicate that these figures were incorrect and in fact annual declines at a rate of 0.6% between 1980 and 2006 are more realistic (Morrison et al. 2006). This equates to a decline of just 5.8% over a ten year period. However, it appears that there are considerably more Long-billed Curlews than previously thought, with a likely global population in the order of 50,000-123,000, based on recent assessments, expert opinion and statistically based surveys (Wetlands International 2006).","Decreasing","This species was once an abundant breeder over most of the prairie regions of the USA and Canada.

Other populations are fully migratory (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong> with females and juveniles leaving the breeding grounds in the western Palearctic from September<strong><sup> </sup></strong>and returning as early as February (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species breeds between March and June (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong> although the exact timing varies with latitude (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. While the females are incubating (Johnsgard 1978)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (from mid-May) (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> the males gather (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> in small flocks and migrate to moulting areas (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong><sup></sup></strong> where they undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for c.4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (females moult near the breeding grounds) (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Outside of the breeding season the species can be found in small to very large flocks (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> numbering up to several hundreds or even thousands of individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> especially when moulting (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, on migration (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and during the winter (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species may also roost both nocturnally and diurnally in communal groups when not breeding (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> The species occurs in almost every wetland type (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong> although it generally avoids fast-flowing, oligotrophic (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, deep, exposed, rough, rockbound waters and hard unvegetated areas such as rocky ground, sand dunes and artificial surfacing (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It requires water less than 1 m deep for foraging (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and shows a preference for freshwater habitats (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> although it may frequent shallow brackish waters as long as they provide the cover (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> of submerged, floating, emergent or riparian vegetation, dense reedbeds or overhanging branches (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Habitats commonly frequented include flooded swampy woodlands, seasonal floodlands (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, wet grassy swamps and meadows, oxbow lakes (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, open waters with mudflats, banks or spits, irrigation networks, reservoirs, ornamental waters (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, canals and sewage farms (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. During the winter the species may also be found in saline habitats along the coast (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong> where water is shallow, fairly sheltered and within site of land (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (e.g. brackish lagoons [Snow and Perrins 1998]<strong><sup></sup></strong>, brackish estuaries [del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998]<strong> </strong>and bays [del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992]<strong><sup></sup></strong>). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is omnivorous and opportunistic (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, feeding by dabbling in water and by grazing on the land (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Its diet consists of seeds and the vegetative parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants (e.g. crops) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, as well as terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates (especially in the spring and summer) such as insects, molluscs, crustaceans, worms and occasionally amphibians and fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong> or bowl of vegetation that can be situated in many different locations such as within vegetation on the ground, in natural tree cavities (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong> up to 10 m high (Africa) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, under fallen dead wood, on tree stumps (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, under bushes (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and even in abandoned nests of other species (e.g. herons or crows) (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Nests are generally placed close to water (Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong> although occasionally they may be some distance away (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Management information</strong> ""Extensive"" grazing of wetland grasslands (c.0.5 cows per hectare) was found to attract a higher abundance of the species in Hungary (Baldi <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

With the banning of these pesticides their impact has fallen as indicated by breeding densities and distributions, migration counts and wintering distributions and numbers. However, some individuals may still be impacted (Warkentin <em>et al. </em>2020), while exposure to mercury is also a cause for concern in some areas (Keyel <em>et al. </em>2020).<em>&#160;</em>The species also suffers collisions with man-made objects (White<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2015). Population declines have also been attributed to loss of suitable habitat through overgrazing or conversion of native grassland into cultivated farmland, insensitive management, and increased tourism disturbing nest sites (Konrad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Predation by Red Fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) is also a threat (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). In North America, falconers harvest a small number of Merlins each year, but this is carefully regulated and is unlikely to have a significant effect on populations (Millsap and Allen 2006). In Ireland, logging of mature trees in conifer plantations may pose a threat to nesting Merlins (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018).","The European population is estimated at 20,000-41,700 pairs, which equates to 40,100-83,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).&#160;Europe forms approximately 15% of the global range so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 267,000-556,000 mature individuals. Partners in Flight (2020) estimate the North American population at approximately 1,600,000 mature individuals, and the global population at 3,200,000 mature individuals. Given the wide range of the population estimates, the global population is placed in the band 250,000-3,200,000 mature individuals.","Stable","","In North America, falconers harvest a small number of Merlins each year, but this is carefully regulated and is unlikely to have a significant effect on populations (Millsap &amp; Allen 2006).","Terrestrial|Marine","<strong>Conservation actions underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendix II, Raptors MOU Category 3, EU Birds Directive Annex I.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is strongly migratory throughout its northern range, although some populations in the Southern Hemisphere are sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005). It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups from April to June, with males leaving the breeding areas first from May to early-June to undertake extensive moult migrations (females following later) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). During moult, large sexually segregated flocks gather in moulting areas (e.g. in the Netherlands and Russia), although small gatherings are also possible (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). The flightless moult period lasts for around 4 weeks between July and August, after which flocks move southwards to winter quarters from mid-August onwards (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). The species is highly gregarious in winter and on passage, often forming enormous concentrations (although the size of flock depends on the size of the wetland) (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds nocturnally; flocks are roosting by day on open water (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat </strong>The species shows a preference for open lowland grassland, prairie or tundra habitats containing freshwater, brackish and saline wetlands with shallow water (10-30 cm deep) to facilitate dabbling (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Wetland habitats include shallow freshwater marshes, small marshy lakes, slow-flowing rivers, wet meadows, flood-plains and sewage ponds (southern Africa), especially favouring ponds with low, dense marginal vegetation and wetlands interspersed with brushy thickets or copses (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). During the winter, it also frequents large inland lakes, brackish coastal lagoons, brackish and saline marshes, shallow fresh or brackish estuaries, tidal flats and river deltas with adjacent agricultural land (e.g. stubble fields) and scattered impoundments (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Steele <em>et al.</em> 1997, Snow and Perrins 1998). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>This species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of algae, seeds (e.g. cereals and rice), tubers (e.g. potatoes), and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants, sedges and grasses, as well as aquatic invertebrates (e.g. insects, molluscs and crustaceans), amphibians and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a slight hollow on the ground amongst vegetation (e.g. rushes, grass or low scrub) and can be close to or more than 1 km away from water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species is not normally colonial, but neighbours may nest as close as 2-3 m apart (Kear 2005).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat loss on its breeding and wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). Reclamation of coastal areas for industrial development poses a threat in Europe, and major river diversion and irrigation schemes threaten wintering areas in Niger and Nigeria (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds in Russia (Grishanov 2006). Over-exploitation is a concern in Europe (Kear 2005). It also suffers poisoning from lead shot ingestion in North America (Baldassarre and Bolen 1994), poisoning from white phosphorous (from firearms) ingestion in Alaska (Steele <em>et al.</em> 1997), and reproductive impairment as a result of selenium accumulation in liver tissues (selenium contained in sub-surface agricultural drain-water used for wetland management in California led to bioaccumulation of the element in the food chain (Paveglio <em>et al.</em> 1997). The species is predated by feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> and rats <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> on islands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), and it is susceptible to avian botulism and avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Rocke 2006, Gaidet <em>et al.</em> 2007), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Utilisation </strong>The species is hunted for sport widely across its range; for example in North America (Baldassarre and Bolen 1994, Schmidt 2006), Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006) and the Po delta, Italy (Sorrenti <em>et al.</em> 2006), and it is also hunted commercially and recreationally in Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). The eggs of this species used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979). The species is also traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The population is estimated to number 7,100,000-7,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). This roughly equates to 4,700,000-4,800,000 mature individuals. The European population is estimated at 210,000-269,000 pairs, which equates to 419,000-539,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Decreasing","","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>CMS Appendix II.

It arrives on the breeding grounds from March<strong><sup> </sup></strong>where it breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups<strong></strong> in the northern spring (chiefly from mid-April to June) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Males undergo a post-breeding moult migration from early-May to early-June (females moulting one month later) during which they are flightless for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The autumn migration chiefly occurs between September and October (western Europe), during which the species is likely to travel on a broad front (e.g. across Arabia and into Africa) (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The species is usually found in pairs or small parties, although it often congregates when feeding (flocks of  20 or 30 to several hundred individuals occur in favoured areas in Africa <strong></strong>and large concentrations form at stop-over sites on migration) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The species forages diurnally and roosts communally at night (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits permanent<strong></strong> shallow freshwater wetlands<strong></strong> from sea level up to 2,900 m (Ethiopia)<strong></strong>, preferred sites being those surrounded by dense stands of reeds or other emergent vegetation whilst being free of overhanging trees or fringing forest (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. Copious submerged aquatic vegetation sheltering abundant planktonic invertebrates is a valuable habitat characteristic (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. Suitable habitats include well-vegetated lakes and marshes and with muddy shores and substrates in open country (e.g. grasslands), as well as oxbow lakes, channels and swamps (former U.S.S.R.) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It also frequents artificial waters bordered by lush grassland such as sewage farms, rice-fields and fish ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005, Musil 2006)<strong></strong>. In the winter it can be found on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal muflats<strong></strong><strong></strong>, estuaries, coastal shorelines, fresh and brackish estuarine marshes, inland seas and brackish or saline inland waters<strong></strong>, occasionally occurring (briefly) on marine waters during migration (although it generally avoids very saline habitats) (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists of small aquatic invertebrates such as adult and larval insects (e.g. caddisfly larvae, damselfly and dragonfly nymphs, adult beetles, bugs <strong></strong>and flies), molluscs, planktonic crustaceans<strong></strong>, the seeds of emergent and aquatic plants (e.g. bulrushes and waterweeds)<strong></strong>, annelids, amphibian spawn, tadpoles, spiders, fish and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (e.g. duckweeds) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a scrape<strong></strong> or depression on the ground in tall grass, among hummocks, in the open<strong></strong> or (rarely) in bulrush marshes (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. Usually the species nests close to water but if grass cover is unavailable in the wetland site it may also nest far away from water under bushes<strong></strong>, in hayfields or in meadows<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Kear 2005). Although it is not a colonial species, several pairs may nest in close proximity (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information </strong>A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg/ha, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006)<strong></strong>. The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK attracted nesting pairs to the area by causing an increase in invertebrate food availability and an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes (Giles 1994)<strong></strong>.

Migrants begin moving to lower latitudes in August and arrive by October, returning in March and April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are generally solitary and usually migrate alone, but may congregate in small groups at roosts or plentiful food sources (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species migrates on broad fronts and is not dependent on land bridges during migration (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001); birds readily cross bodies of water using flapping flight, but can soar easily over land. It is entirely diurnal (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits the areas around shallow waters, being sufficiently tolerant of human settlement to persist in suburban and sometimes urban environments (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> Almost its entire diet consists of live fish (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Birds usually build large nests high in exposed trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Reintroduction has helped populations to recover across parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).</p>","Human persecution was the main historical threat, prevalent from the 18<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). A combination of deforestation and the collection of eggs and live birds drove the species extinct in Azerbaijan (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).&#160;<br/><br/>In the U.S.A. (and to a lesser extent elsewhere), numbers fell significantly from 1950-1970 as a result of pesticide use, although they are now recovering, as they are in Scotland where the species had been extirpated by collection and hunting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Pesticide use has now been reduced to a minor, and largely historical, threat. However shooting still affects many birds on migration in the Mediterranean (Monti <em>et al. </em>2018b), as well as wintering birds in tropical regions including Latin America and the West Indies (Global Raptor Information Network 2015).&#160;A few Australian birds are apparently impacted by local human disturbance (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).<br/><br/>It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Since 1979, the effect of human activity on osprey mortality has fallen (De Pascalis <em>et al</em>. 2020), though birds are still at risk of deliberate shooting and entanglement in fish nets (ibid, see also Monti <em>et al. </em>2018b). Though there is no direct evidence for its effect on osprey populations, intensive trawler fishing is likely to deplete fish stocks and affect prey availability. Other fishing practices are also likely damaging; copper sulphate fishing may lead to poisoning and motor boats may disturb osprey nests (Monti <em>et al. </em>2013). The scale of these threats is unknown.","The European population is estimated at 9,600-13,600 pairs, which equates to 19,200-27,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep</em>). Europe forms approximately 14% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 137,000-200,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.&#160;It has been listed as regionally endangered in North Africa, where the population has been estimated as lying between 130 and 146 mature individuals (Garrido<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al. in prep</em>).&#160;<br/><br/>The Partners in Flight Science Committee (2021) estimate that the North American population is 400,000 mature individuals.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>Birds are highly migratory in the temperate and Arctic parts of its range, moving from North America to South America, Europe to Africa, and northern Asia to southern Asia and Indonesia. Those breeding at lower latitudes or in the Southern Hemisphere tend to be resident (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean. Most birds travel singly or in pairs, even on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits an extreme variety of habitats, tolerating wet and dry, hot and cool climates, from sea level up to c.4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> Birds make up most of its diet, principally pigeons and doves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Eggs are usually laid in a scrape or depression in a rock face, with no nest being built (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Populations recovered following the ban of harmful hydrocarbons in most countries, which appears important to the birdsâ survival (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Historically, the species was affected by shooting in the U.K., notably during the Second World War (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Persecution throughout its range was the major threat in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Snow and Perrins 1998). While persecution has decreased significantly since the species received legal protection, illegal persecution still occurs in some areas, for example four Peregrines were confirmed illegally poisoned and nine shot, trapped, or nests destroyed in the UK in 2014 (RSPB 2014). Severe population declines in the 1960s-1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Rock climbing activities may pose a threat to the species's nest sites (Global Raptor Information Network 2015), and careless methods of field study may result in abandonment of eggs (White <em>et al. </em>2020). In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). In North Africa, the main threat to the species is illegal trapping and collection of nestlings for use in falconry (Garrido <em>et al. in prep</em>). It is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012), and collision or electrocution from electricity cables may be common in some areas (White <em>et al. </em>2020). An oil spill in northern Spain was thought to have reduced reproductive success and caused adult mortality in the local population (Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2006). Urban fledglings are at threat from collisions with cars, windows and other man-made objects (White <em>et al. </em>2020). Warming of sea temperatures may reduce plankton and associated seabirds that serve as a food source for some populations of Peregrine Falcons (Nelson &amp; Myres 1976).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020) estimate the population in the USA/ Canada to be c.72,000 individuals. The North African population is estimated to be 2,290-2,900 pairs (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>). The European population is estimated at 16,100-31,100 pairs, which equates to 32,200-62,100 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms approximately 13% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 248,000-478,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. The population is therefore placed in the band 100,000-499,999 mature individuals.","Increasing","","The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).

Systematic breeding schemes are in place in at least 21 European countries (Derlink <em>et al. </em>2018). The tree-nesting population in central and eastern Europe declined from c. 4,000 pairs to extirpation, before restoration efforts in Germany and Poland returned it to c. 20 pairs. Significant further efforts are needed to fully restore it across its former range, which included Germany, Poland, Russia, Belarus and the Baltic States (European Peregrine Falcon Working Group<em> in litt.</em> 2007).

It feeds primarily on mussels, clams, arthropods, snails, worms and small fish. Breeding in San Francisco Bay is from mid March-July, peaking in late June; the clutch size is 4-14 eggs.","This species was originally threatened by hunting, but more contemporary  threats include development for industry, agriculture, saltpans and  urbanisation, leading to a drastic reduction in its habitat (Taylor and  van Perlo 1998). By the late 1980s, c.85% of the speciesâs habitat in  the 1850s had been lost, with much of the remaining habitat in a  degraded state (Ehrlich <em>et al</em>. 1992). Urban development,  pollution and introduced predators continue to pose major threats  (Taylor and van Perlo 1998, Schwarzbach <em>et al</em>. 2006). Population declines in the nominate form were accelerated (numbers dropped by nearly 50% over a nine-year period) when invasive Spartina vegetation was removed leading to habitat loss (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2013; Lampert <em>et al</em>. 2014; Casazza <em>et al</em>. 2016). Changes in agricultural water supply and management of agriculture water runoff may affect habitat availability at the Salton Sea (C. T. Overton <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Sea level rise poses a significant future threat (Zhang and Gorelick&#160;2014; Rosencranz <em>et al</em>. 2019). A recent novel and severe chigger mite infection is also threatening populations of form <em>yumanensis</em>&#160;in southwestern Arizona where upwards of 92% of some sub-populations are infested with the mite; such infestations may result in population declines of this form (Harrity and Conway 2019).","<p>The population of <em>obsoletus </em>in 2009-2011 was estimated at 1,167 individuals (range 954-1,426) using both survey data and model predictions of densities for&#160;unsurveyed&#160;sites (Liu&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012a,b). Application of the same methodology to data from 2005-2008 yields an average population estimate of 1,719 individuals (range 1,169 to 2,172;&#160;Liu&#160;<em>et&#160;al</em>.&#160;2012a). Form&#160;<em>levipes&#160;</em>has been estimated to number 633 pairs in the USA (Zembal <em>et al</em>. 2015) and c.240 pairs in Mexico (Eddleman&#160;<em>et al. </em>1988; Ehrlich&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1992), while form&#160;<em>yumanensis&#160;</em>has been estimated to number 1,700-2,000 individuals (Ehrlich<em>&#160;et al. </em>1992). A more recent population estimate, however, put the population at 6,629 individuals (95% CI: 4,859-8,399) in the Colorado River delta region of Mexico (Hinojosa-Herta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001). There are apparently no published population estimates for&#160;<em>beldingi</em>. The total population is therefore uncertain and whilst Partners in Flight (2019) estimate that the population currently exceeds 15,000 mature individuals, it is tentatively placed here within the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.</p><p></p>","Decreasing","<em>Rallus obsoletus</em><em> </em>(incorporating <em>levipes</em>, <em>yumanensis</em> and <em>beldingi</em>) is found along the western coasts of the <strong>USA </strong>and <strong>Mexico</strong>, disjunctly from San Francisco and San Pablo bays, California, south to Baja California Sur and southern Nayarit, Mexico.<br/>The nominate form is confined to central California, mainly in San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Bay (and Suisun Bay; Overton 2007).

However, it may still be an important cause of mortality in some areas, particularly on wintering grounds (Bechard <em>et al. </em>2020).&#160;It also suffers mortality from collisions with cars, electrocution from powerlines (Mebs and Schmidt 2006) and&#160;accidental capture in traps set for fur-bearing mammals (Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). The species may also suffer reduced reproductive success from fluctuating weather caused by climate change (Pokrovsky&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). An increase in rainfall caused by climate change may increase the risk of nest collapse (Beardsell <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;In the past, organochlorine pesticide treatments were thought to pose a threat to the species in the U.S.A. (Henny <em>et al</em>. 1984). Grazing livestock in meadows and marshes may reduce the suitability of these habitats for foraging in overwintering areas (Littlefield <em>et al.</em>1992).","The European population is estimated at 28,800-58,200 pairs, which equates to 57,600-117,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.). Europe forms approximately 15% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 384,000-780,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. The Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020a) estimate the global population to be 590,000 (equivalent to 395,000 mature individuals), based on a population of 300,000 in the USA and Canada.

In the non-breeding season it occurs in a variety of habitats, including scrubland, arid thorn forest and mixed pine-oak-juniper forest (Healy and Calder 2006, Powers <em>et al. </em>2018). It feeds on nectar from several different plant species, as well as on arthropod prey (Powers <em>et al. </em>2018), and breeding may be timed to coincide with the flowering of food plants (Powers <em>et al. </em>2018) (recorded from end of March to mid July; Healy and Calder 2006).","In some cases human activity may actually benefit this species. Forest degradation may increase the availability of certain food flowers (see Healy and Calder 2006), and food availability can be artificially increased by the presence of feeders, which can also help increase abundance (Healy and Calder 2006, Powers&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;However, while the species may tolerate some forest degradation, habitat destruction could impact the species (Rosenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Powers&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018); forest loss is currently estimated at ~5% across the stipulated ten year period throughout this species's range (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). As this species is typically found in cooler climates, climate change is likely to be a potential threat (Rosenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

The species is found on low, grassy tundra, generally in close association with water (ponds, shallow lakes or river deltas) or on stony ground. Breeding begins in June usually as soon as areas become free of snow and generally within 7-10 days of arrival on nesting grounds. It is monogamous, often for life, although extra-pair copulations have been recorded. The nest is built by the female, who chooses the site as well and is a shallow depression filled with moss and lined with grass and down on the ground. Normally five or six eggs are laid. The diet is principally vegetarian, comprising of roots, tubers, leaves, grasses, stems and seed heads of various aquatic plants and sedges. The species is migratory (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Despite hunting pressure this species is increasing in numbers (Kear 2005; Mowbray <em>et al</em>. 2020). Climatic effects may impact the species in the future (Murphy-Klassen <em>et al</em>. 2005).","The global population is estimated to number 15,000,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2020). The European population is estimated at 1,000-2,000 pairs, which equates to 2,000-4,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).","Increasing","","The species is widely hunted throughout its range for recreation and to regulate the rapid population growth, but the population increase is continuing (Mowbray <em>et al</em>. 2020).","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix II.","Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic",NA,"false","false","Global",10,0,0,0

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","","","","Stable","","","Terrestrial","","Antarctic|Nearctic|Neotropical",NA,"false","false","Global",0,0,0,0

The population along the U.S. Pacific coast is resident, while populations elsewhere migrate to non-breeding grounds in southern U.S.A. and northern South America. Individuals begin departing the breeding grounds in late summer, with males preceding females by up to one month (Whitehead 1965, Tuck 1972). Spring migration peaks during late March, but may begin as early as late February or early March (Tuck 1972). The species forages in soft mud by probing for invertebrates and plant material (Tuck 1972). The species requires habitats composed of moist soils with an interspersion of soil and shallow water (Rundle 1981). It prefers habitats with short vegetation, including agricultural fields and pastures, but is less common on open mudflats or continuous areas of open water (Tuck 1972, Rundle 1981, Long &amp; Ralph 2001). Lack of rainfall can decrease the habitat quality for the species (Arnold 1994). On the non-breeding grounds, factors like changing water levels across a  region (e.g. coastal habitats, inland habitats), temperature,  agricultural practices and other anthropogenic factors contribute to  changing numbers at various locations (Robbins 1952, Carroll 2011).","The most severe threat to the species is the continuing loss and degradation of wetlands throughout the range (American Bird Conservancy 2018). Proposed changes to the Clean Water Act of the United States may lead to an increase of agriculture, mining and development in inland wetlands.","The population is estimated to number 2,000,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019). In the lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley in Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana (U.S.A.), non-breeding densities of c. 8 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 4.57-14.17) were estimated in 2009 and c. 2 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 1.47-3.08) in 2010 (Carroll and Krementz 2014). Based on these densities, the population in this area was estimated at c. 1,026,000 individuals in 2009 and at 272,000 in 2010 (Carroll and Krementz 2014).","Increasing","","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","<strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>Hunting of the species follows the guidelines of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
