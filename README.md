# A repository for:
Haight, Jeffrey D.; Bateman, Heather L.; Frazier, Amy E.; Larson, Kelli L.; Susannah B. Lerman; Paige S. Warren; Albuquerque, Fabio S. Hot in the city: impacts of climate variability and urban landscape change on birds

This repository contains code and data used for fitting a temporally autoregressive community occupancy model to bird occurrence data across multiple spring sampling seasons, analyzing model parameters, and producing visualizations based on these results. Occurrence data were collected at 51 long-term bird point-count censusing locations across central Arizona, USA, as part of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) program.


This `README` file includes information on the various scripts and datasets used for this analysis, though not every data source is saved in this repository due to data size limitations (the fitted occupany model object; GIS data). The manuscript includes citation of sources of environmental data. This `README` file is organized into three sections corresponding to the three main folders into which the repository is organized
1. [code](#code)  
2. [data](#data)
3. [figures](#figures)
